### Logic folder description

In this folder logic components are stored. For example: controllers, routers, basket logic, form element handlers, pagination logic, server and data storage interaction logic and so on.

Each class has to be placed in **its own** file. Classes, its interfaces and types have to be in the **their own separate** folder!
